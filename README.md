## Ruby Learning Journey 💎

I’m learning **Ruby from scratch**, exploring core concepts step by step.

### 📚 Learning Resources
- Official Ruby Documentation
- https://www.theodinproject.com

### 🎯 Goal
To build a strong foundation in Ruby by practicing basics, understanding object-oriented concepts, and writing clean code.
Then Move to ROR (Ruby on Rails).

This repository contains my **practice code, experiments, and notes** as I learn.
